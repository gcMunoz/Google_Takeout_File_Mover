With minor adjustments done to two existing packages of Google Photos Takeout, I'm somewhat confident that this
program will work at moving all image and video files out of their individually dated folders. A lot of 
directories store .json files for configuration things I suppose, so I try to isolate those files from 
my exclusive search. 

To use this project, you will need a few things:

1. A Google account with Photos uploaded to photos.google.com
2. A directory where you want to move your downloaded photos to

To begin, start by visiting takeout.google.com

Next, log into your account, then choose the data you would like to export.
Since this program is mostly catered towards a specific set of data, your photos,
I would advice using this program on one particular set of data as all files moved
are simply put into one directory.

Click "Next step", and choose your frequency. I would choose "Export once".

Click "Create export". Depending on how large your export is, you may get an email instead
of an instant download link. 

If prompted, click "Download" next to your export. You should now have a zip file with
the name "takeout-(exportID)-(exportSegmentNumber).zip"

Unzip the file, and now you should have a "Takeout" folder.

Now, using this program, you can start moving photos into a 
separate directory.

Be sure to always choose the "Google Photos" directory that will be found after unzipping
your data.
